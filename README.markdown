**EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET**

The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper questions Luke.

**TROOPER:** How long have you had these droids?

**LUKE:** About three or four seasons.

**BEN:** They’re for sale if you want them.

**TROOPER:** Let me see your identification.

Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

**BEN:** You don’t need to see his identification.

**TROOPER:** We don’t need to see his identification.

**BEN:** These are not the droids your looking for.

**TROOPER:** These are not the droids we’re looking for.

**BEN:** He can go about his business.

**TROOPER:** You can go about your business.

**BEN:** (to Luke) Move along.

**TROOPER:** Move along. Move along.
